The Midterm Exam will be on **Friday, 30 June 2023** and it will last the entire class period of 75 minutes.  

The exam will consist of at least one problem per unit.  
Units 1 through 7 will be covered.  

You will be allowed one sheet of reference, front side only. You may not bring/write down the study guide problems and the solutions on the reference sheet.  
You may not have example problems and solutions on the reference sheet. Reference sheet will be for references only, i.e. any formula you may have to remember, acronyms, definitions, etc.  

## Midterm Exam Study Guide

You must show **all** work and explain all solutions to the fullest extent.  
Partial credit where appropriate.  

The actual exam will have different numbers for the problems, but the problem format will remain identical.  

* Unit 1
  1. Evaluate $$\frac{4}{10} \div \frac{4}{10}$$.
  2. Evaluate $$(5-\frac{5}{9})^2$$.
  3. Evaluate $$(-5)^2 - 5^2$$. 
* Unit 2
  1. Tell the story of $$x$$ in the following expression: $$\frac{(8x-2)^3}{7}$$ (What is the order of the operations involved?)
  2. Evaluate $$4x^2 + 9x - 2$$ for $$x = -8$$. 
  3. Suppose that the hypotenuse (i.e. the longest side of a right triangle) is 16 units long and one of the two sides is 7 units long. What is the measurement of the remaining side?
* Unit 3
  1. What are the nonzero terms in the expression $$x^7 - 16x^4 - \frac{1}{24}x^3 + 24x + 25$$? In other words, state the coefficient and the exponents associated with each term in this polynomial.
  2. Simplify $$-(-7x + 3) + (x^2 + 8x - 8)$$. 
  3. Simplify $$\frac{4(9n-12) + 15}{3} + 12n - 11$$.
* Unit 4
  1. True or false? $$t=-1$$ is a solution to $$-t - 3 = -2$$. 
  2. Solve the equation: $$-7y + 2 = -33$$.
  3. Solve the equation: $$(-5z + 5) - (-7z - 3) = 21z + 27$$.
* Unit 5
  1. Graph $$x \geq 2$$. Write the inequality in its equivalent interval notation.
  2. A student has scores of 62, 63, and 72 on his first three tests. He needs an average of at least 70 to earn a grade of C in the class. What is the minimum score that the student needs on the fourth test to ensure a C?
  3. Solve the inequality: $$18x \leq -3(-2x+24)$$
* Unit 6
  1. Plot the points (0, -4), (-3, 0), (-1, 1), (-3, 1). 
  2. Graph $$y = -3$$. What are the intecepts written in ordered pairs?
  3. Graph $$y = \mid x \mid - 3$$. What are the intercepts?
* Unit 7
  1. Which of the following ordered pairs satisfy the equation $$y = 2$$? (6,2), (5,3), (-1,2), (-2,2), (-3,0). Make sure to explain why and how.
  2. Graph $$y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 2$$. Identify the intercepts algebraically (i.e. not by referring to the graph).
  3. Graph $$8x + 4y = -48$$. Identify the intercepts.

## What do we mean by inequality?

There is this thing called the **trichotomy law** in mathematics, which state the following (rather obvious) statements: for any number $$x$$, $$x$$ is only one of the following:
* $$x < 0$$
* $$x = 0$$
* $$x < 0$$

This statement is useful for analyzing inequalities. For an instance, let $$a, b$$ be any numbers. Then, $$a - b$$ is a well-defined value (in other words, we can always subtract two numbers, if the numbers we are referring to include at least the integers). So, the following propositions are equivalent:
* $$a < b$$ if and only if $$b - a  > 0$$
* $$a = b$$ if and only if $$b - a = 0$$
* $$a > b$$ if and only if $$b - a < 0$$

Notice that this can also be used to see which fractions are greater than the other...

## Interval Notation

Suppose that $$a, b$$ are numbers where $$a < b$$ and either $$a$$ or $$b$$ can be positive or negative infinity. Then, there are four possible configurations to the __interval notation__:  

* $$(a,b): $$a < x < b$$  
* $$(a,b]: $$a < x \leq b$$  
* $$[a,b): $$a \leq x < b$$  
* $$[a,b]: $$a \leq x \leq b$$

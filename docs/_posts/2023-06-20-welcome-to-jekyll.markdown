Algebra 1 Review
Loyola High School of Los Angeles
Summer 2023 - Won

Syllabus

This course is intended to be a 1 month fast-paced refresher on topics in Elementary Algebra (Algebra 1). All of the topics covered in a traditional Algebra 1 curriculum will be covered, meaning one yearâ€™s worth of curriculum will be squeezed into one month. It is imperative that you are vigilant about the coursework as the pace will be demanding. With this being said, the prerequisite for the course is that you have taken Algebra 1 before, and you are familiar with the times table. Requirements for the course are simply pen & pencil for in-class work and a connection to the internet at home for homework assignments.

* Unit 8: Graph $$x = |y|$$. Is this a function or not? Why and how?
* Unit 9: Create an $$xy$$ chart and graph the following function: $$f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 6$$. Do not refer to the linear equations you will see in units 10 and 11.
* Unit 10: Provide example graphs of an increasing line, decreasing line, a horizontal line, and a vertical line. Then, explain how the notion of slope correlates to the notion of the behavior or the function.
* Unit 11: Provide the equation for a line where the line passes through (-2, -12) and (3, 18).

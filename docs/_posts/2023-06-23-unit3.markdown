An algebraic expression is simply a mathematical sequence of numbers and symbols where the symbols represent [variables](https://chrisdongwon.github.io/Algebra1-Review-LoyolaSummer23/lecture/notes/2023/06/21/unit2.html). An equation is a mathematical expression where there is an _equals_ ($$=$$) sign somewhere in the middle of the sequence. In other words, we are concerned whether the left hand side of the equals sign will be _equivalent_, if not _identical_ to the expression on the other side. In evaluating these algebraic expressions will help us answer whether or not an algebraic equality is a true statement or not. What do I mean by this? For an example, consider the following algebraic equation:  
$$3x + 7 = 9x - 11$$  
Sure, you might have been told how to proceed with these types of expressions _mechanically_. Without doing any "solving" (solving for algebraic equality will be the main focus of the next section), let us simply look at the algebraic expression as it is written - then the question really boils down to the following:  

**For what $$x$$ values would make the left hand side equal to the right hand side?**  

In order to facilitate this process, it is beneficial to have the expressions as simplified as possible. In order to simplify, here are the _rules_ of algebraic manipulation, called the [field axioms](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FieldAxioms.html).  

1. Addition and multplication are commutative, i.e. order does not matter. Symbolically, for all numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$, we have $$a+b=b+a$$ and $$ab=ba$$.  

2. Addition and multiplication are associative, i.e. the pairing does not matter. Symbolically, for all numbers $$a, b, c$$, we have $$(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$$ and $$a(bc)=a(bc)$$. 

3. Addition and multiplication have identity elements, respectively. Let us recall that the _additive identity_ is a fancy name for 0 and _multiplicative identity_ is a fancy name for 1. Mathematically,
    * For any number $$a$$, there exists a number $$b$$ such that $$a + b = a$$. Here, we say that $$b$$ is the _additive identity_ of $$a$$, meaning $$b = 0$$.  
    * For any number $$a$$, there exists a number $$b$$ such that $$ab = a$$. Here, we say that $$b$$ is the _multiplicative identity_ of $$a$$, meaning $$b = 1$$.  

4. Addition and multiplication have inverse elements, respectively. Let us recall that the _additive inverse_ is a fancy name for the negative numbers and the _multiplicative inverse_ is a fancy name for the reciprocals.
    * For any number $$a$$, there exists a number $$b$$ such that $$a + b = 0$$, Here, we say that $$b$$ is the _additive inverse_ of $$a$$, meaning $$b = -a$$.  
    * For any nonzero number $$a$$, there exists a number $$b$$ such that $$ab = 1$$. Here, we say that $$b$$ is the _multiplicative inverse_ of $$a$$, meaning $$b = \frac{1}{a}$$. [Do you remember why zero does not have a reciprocal](https://chrisdongwon.github.io/Algebra1-Review-LoyolaSummer23/lecture/notes/2023/06/21/unit1.html)? Later on, we will also express the reciprocal with a negative exponent, i.e. $$\frac{1}{a} = a^{-1}$$. We will talk about what we mean by this in the section below.

5. Distributive Property: The notion that multiplication is a repeated addition is solidified with this property. There are two versions of this property. For all numbers $$a, b, c$$, we have that:
    * $$a(b+c) = ab + ac$$ (this is called _left distribution_) and 
    * $$(a+b)c = ac + bc$$ (this is called _right distribution_).

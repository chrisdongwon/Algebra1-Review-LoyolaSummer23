Our first in-class quiz will take place on **Monday, 26 June 2023**. It will be handed out during the last 15 minutes of our class time. The quiz is intended to be 10 to 15 minutes long.  

You are allowed one **Front Side of Letter Sized (8.5 in. by 11 in.) Paper** as a cheat-sheet. You are encouraged to write down any material that you may have hard time memorizing, as the quiz will contain a terminology section.  

I will be posting the study guide questions throughout the weekend, so make sure to check regularly to prepare for the exam. I will put up some potential quiz questions here after class today.

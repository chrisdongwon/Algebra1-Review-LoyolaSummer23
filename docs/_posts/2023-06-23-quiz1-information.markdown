Our first in-class quiz will take place on **Monday, 26 June 2023**. It will be handed out during the last 15 minutes of our class time. The quiz is intended to be 10 to 15 minutes long.  

You are allowed one **Front Side of Letter Sized (8.5 in. by 11 in.) Paper** as a cheat-sheet. You are encouraged to write down any material that you may have hard time memorizing, as the quiz will contain a terminology section. The quiz will cover Units 1, 2, and 3 (Not 4). 

The quiz will consist of 4 of the following 8 questions.  

1. What is the definition of a rational number? (Do you remember the three conditions?)
2. Can you explain why we cannot divide by zero? In other words, why do we say that the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero?
3. We say a fraction equals 0 when the numerator is 0, and a fraction equals 1 when the numerator equals the denominator. In this sense, we can say that $$\frac{0}{0} = 1$$ and $$\frac{0}{0} = 0$$. What is wrong with this argument? (Hint: what are the three requirements for a rational number?)
4. Suppose that we want to evaluate $$\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}$$ for rational numbers $$\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d}$$. What is the sum if $$b = d$$? In the case that $$b \not = d$$, what is one general approach towards the evaluation? Express the sum using your approach of choice. Hint: we need _something_ in common.
5. What are the two _versions_ of the distributive property? Demonstrate how the combination of the two versions imply the FOIL technique. 
6. Evaluate $$(\frac{1}{3}+ \frac{2}{5})^2$$.
7. Evaluate $$9n^3 - n^2$$ when $$n = -3$$. 
8. Suppose that a square has side length $$s$$. Draw a square and explain why the perimeter must be $$4s$$.

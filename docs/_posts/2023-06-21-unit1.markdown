Let us begin with some basic notions of arithmetic:  

* Natural numbers: $$\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots \} $$  
(Here, $$\mathbb{N}$$ represents the _set_ of natural numbers.)  

Notice that the only reasonable operation to perform on the natural numbers is addition, and consqeuently multiplication, which is simply repeated addition in our case. 

Also, it appears that we just need 0 and 1 in order to express any natural number in terms of addition. As an example, $$4 = ((((0 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1)$$, meaning perhaps, the symbol 4 is simply a representation of four instance of 1's in series. For a deep explanation on this, look into [Peano Axioms]({% link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms %}).

When dealing with the natural numbers, notice that subtraction and division are not always meaningful. As an example, notice that $$1 - 2 = -1$$, which is not a natural number, and $$1 \div 2 = \frac{1}{2}$$, which is also not a natural number. So, we need to be slightly more cautious when dealing with subtraction and division.

So, what are the requirement in order to facilitate subtraction? Let us recall that _subtraction_ in an algebraic sense is addition by the negative, technically referred to as the additive inverse. So, now we introduce the notion of **integers**:

* Integers: $$\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$$
(Here, $\mathbb{Z}$$ represents the set of integers. Z stands for Zahlen, German for numbers). Now, the number 0 has a bit more significance than it did with just the natural numbers. Of course, any number added to 0 is simply that number. This was true with the natural numbers as well. However, with the introduction of the negative whole numbers, we also see that whenever a number is paired with its negative in addition, the sum will always be 0. In this sense, we refer to 0 as the _additive identity_. Why the fancy terms? You will see why when we start discussing division.

## Arithmetic and Geometric Progression

Let us go back to the world of natural numbers real quick. Recall that this means we are only talking about the nonnegative integers, meaning whole numbers from 0 and onward. Besides the usual 0, 1, 2, 3, and onward, there are more "patterns" (mathematically known as __sequences__) that one could generate, using addition and multiplication respectively.

For an example, let us generate a sequence of integers from 1 by repeatedly **adding** and **multiplying** by 2. 

* Sequence generated by **adding** 2 to 1: 1, 3, 5, 7, ... (the positive odd integers)
* Sequence generated by **multipying** 2 to 1: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... (the powers of 2)

The first type is what we refer to as an _arithmetic progression_, a sequence obtained by repeated adddition, and _geometric progression_, a sequence obtained by repeated multiplication. 

Let us come up with the formulae for these sequences. Notice that the following expression is equivalent to the sequence above:

* Sequence generated by **adding** 2 to 1: $$1 + 2n$$, where $$n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$$ (i.e. the natural numbers)
* Sequence generated by **multipying** 2 to 1: $$2^n$$, where $$n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$$ (i.e. the natural numbers)

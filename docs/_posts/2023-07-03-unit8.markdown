In mathematics, there is a notion of __well-defined__ vs. __undefined__ (or ill-defined). It is implied that the functions we speak of are __well-defined__ functions in mathematics, and here is what that entails:

* function: a designation of a number $$x$$ to $$y$$, where the set of numbers where $$x$$ originates from is referred to as the __domain__ and the __range__ (formally, codomain) for $$y$$. Here, $$x$$ is colloquially referred to as the **input** and $$y$$ as the **output**. 

Just like how we had __conditions__ for our mathematical definition of fractions, we have a similar restriction on the notion of functions as well. In order for a function to be well defined, we say that an input is designated to one and only one output, if it has a designation. Otherwise, we say that the function is ill-defined, hence undefined. Formally, we say that: for all inputs $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$, if $$x_1 = x_2$$, then $$f(x_1) = f(x_2)$$, where $$f(x_i) = y_i$$ for $$i = 1, 2$$. (Notice that f(x) and y refer to the same value, just a different notation). 

In other words, if we have to choose an output for an input, we say that it is an ill-defined function. As an example, think of a parabola sideways: $$x = y^2$$. You will easily see that for any $$x$$ value greater than 0, there exist 2 possible output values for $$x$$. For an example, if $$x = 4$$, then $$y = 2$$ or $$y = -2$$. Once again, just one output per input is the requirement here. An output may have different input values, but per input, there must be exactly upto one output. 

Thus, this idea is the formalization of what we refer to as the __vertical line test__. 

## Inverse functions

We say that the function $$f$$ is a collection (or a set) of infinitely many points $$(x, f(x))$$. We then say that the inverse of $$f$$, noted $$f^{-1}$$, is the collection of $$(f(x), x)$$, meaning the x and the y coordinates are swapped. Graphically. this corresponds to __flipping__ the graph of $$f$$ across the diagonal line, $$y = x$$. Notationwise, we need to be **extra careful** here, as -1 we see here is the reference to function inverse, not the multiplicative inverse!!! As an example, we see that the inverse function of $$y = x$$ is simply $$y = x$$, not $$x^{-1} = frac{1}{x}$$. **Later on in Geometry and Precalculus, you will be introduced to the notion of inverse trigonometric functions**. More on this in class. 

If time allows in class, I will introduce the notion of __one-to-one__ and __onto__ functions.

Let us recall that a variable is simply a representation of any number. Traditionally, $$x$$ is the designated letter/symbol for a variable. When other variables need to be referenced, other letters can be used as well. However, let us remember that same instance of the variables refer to the same value. As an example, the expression $$x \cdot x$$ refers to multiplication where the left $$x$$ and the right $$x$$ refer to the same value designated for $$x$$. 

Let us review the rules of arithmetics in rational numbers using variables. Let $$\frac{a}{b}$$ and $$\frac{c}{d}$$ be rational numbers. Recall that this implies the following:

1.  $$a, b, c, d$$ are all integers  
2. $$b, d$$ are not zeroes  
3. All the common primes among $$a, b$$ and $$c, d$$ have been cancelled out, respectively. In other words, $$\frac{a}{b}$$ and $$\frac{b}{d}$$ are in their simplest forms.  

With this in mind, let us review some of the key properties of fraction arithmetic:  

* When are two fractions equal? There are two schools of thoughts that are equivalent:
    1. When $$a = c$$ and $$b = d$$ (The numerators and the denominators are the same)
    2. When $$ad = bc$$ ("Cross-multiplication" tecnique).

To see why the second assertion is true, consider the following. Let's say we want to compare $$\frac{a}{b}$$ and $$\frac{b}{d}$$. In order to compare in fractions, we need to have a common denominator - intuitively speaking, it is because we are counting how many parts when each part is equally _cut_ - and the size of this _cut_ is precisely what we refer to as the denominator / divisor. So, it appears that a common multiple of $$b$$ and $$d$$ is simply $$bd$$, and it follows that $$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot 1 = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{d} = \frac{ad}{bd}$$, and similarly, $$\frac{c}{d} = 1 \cdot \frac{c}{d}= \frac{b}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{bc}{bd}$$. Now can we can use the first reasoning to see how the fractions compare. 

* Provided that the fractions in comparison are both positive, how do we see which fraction is greater? There are few tecniques to facilitate this:
  1. If the denominators are the same, simply compare the numerators (E.g. How many slices of pie did I eat vs. did you eat?)  
  2. If the numerators are the same, then compare the denominators (E.g. Is a slice of a whole pizza cut in half bigger than a slice of a whole pizze sliced up in 20 equally sized slices?) Notice that greater the denominator, smaller the quantity.  
  3. Algebraically, $$\frac{a}{b} < \frac{c}{d}$$ if $$ad < bc$$, provided that the fractions in comparison are both positive to begin with.

* Adding/subtracting Fractions: Recall that addition and subtraction in fraction only makes sense when we have a common denominator. Thus, the proposed formula gives us _any_ sum and differences of two fractions: $$\frac{a}{b} \pm \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad \pm bc}{bd}$$. 

* Multiplying/dividing Fractions: Luckily, multiplication and division are more natural operations to perform on fractions. Similarly, we state that $$\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}$$ and $$\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c} = \frac{ad}{bc}$$.

The Final Exam will be on **Thursday, 13 July 2023** and it will last the entire class period of 75 minutes.  

The exam will consist of at least one problem per unit.  
Units 1 through 14 will be covered.  

You will be allowed one sheet of reference, front side only, with the following exceptions:
  * You may not bring/write down the study guide problems and the solutions on the reference sheet.  
  * You may not have example problems and solutions on the reference sheet. Reference sheet will be for references only, i.e. any formula you may have to remember, acronyms, definitions, etc.  

## Final Exam Study Guide

You must show **all** work and explain all solutions to the fullest extent. Partial credit will be awarded where appropriate.  

1. Evaluate $$\displaystyle \frac{11}{(\frac{2}{3} - (-\frac{5}{7}))^3}$$.
2. Evaluate $$(-2a)^b$$ where $$a = 2$$ and $$b = 5$$.
3. Simplify $$\displaystyle \frac{12-15x}{3}$$.
4. Solve for $$x$$: $$\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 6 + \frac{4}{5}x$$
5. Express $$\vert x \vert < 10$$ in interval notation, and explain the reasoning.
6. Graph $$x = -2$$, and identify all intercepts.
7. Graph $$8y + 48x = 24$$, and identify all intercepts.
8. Graph $$x = -y^2$$. Is this a function? Why or why not?
9. Suppose that $$f(x) = -5x + 1$$. Determine $$x$$ when $$f(x) = 16$$.
10. Find the equation of a line connecting $$(3,10)$$ and $$(12, 28)$$.
11. Find the equation of a line connecting $$(3,10)$$ and $$(3, 1000)$$.
12. Graph $$10x + 5y > 30$$. Remember that this involves either a solid or dotted line and a region to be shaded.
13. Using either the substitution or the elimination method, solve the following system of linear equations: $$11x + 6y = -50$$ and $$-33x + 8y = 124$$. Make sure to indicate which method you have utilized.
14. Simplify $$(a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$$. Hint: FOIL is not very useful here. Do you remember your distributive property, e.g. $$a(b + (c + \ldots)) = ab + a(c + \ldots)$$

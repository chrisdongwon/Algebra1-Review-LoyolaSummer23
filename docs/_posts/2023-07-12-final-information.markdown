The exam will consist of at least one problem per unit.  
Units 1 through 14 will be covered.  

You will be allowed one sheet of reference, front side only, with the following exceptions:
  * You may not bring/write down the study guide problems and the solutions on the reference sheet.

## Final Exam Study Guide

You must show **all** work and explain all solutions to the fullest extent. Partial credit will be awarded where appropriate.  

1. Evaluate $$\frac{11}{(\frac{2}{3} - (-\frac{5}{7}))^3}$$.
2. Evaluate $$(-2a)^b$$ where $$a = 2$$ and $$b = 5$$.
3. Simplify $$\frac{12-15x}{3}$$.
4. Solve for $$x$$: $$\frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 6 + \frac{4}{5}x$$
5. Express $$|x| < 10$$ in interval notation, and explain the reasoning.
6. Graph $$x = -2$$, and identify all intercepts.
7. Graph $$8y + 48x = 24$$, and identify all intercepts.
8. Graph $$x = -y^2$$. Is this a function? Why or why not?
9.

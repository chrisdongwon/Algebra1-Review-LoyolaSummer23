**Orthogonality** is simply a term referring to whether a line is parallel or perpendicular. If the lines are perpendicular, we say that they are __orthogonal__. 

So, let us assess what we mean by parallel and perpendicular lines, as far as this class goes.

* parallel: We say that two lines are parallel if they have the same slope regardless of the y-intercept value.
* perpendicular: We say that two lines are perpendicular if the product (e.g. multiplication) of the slopes for the two lines equals -1.

Let us see what this means symbolically. Suppose that the first line is represented by $$y = ax + b$$ and the second line is represented by $$z = cx + d$$.

* parallel: The slope for the first line is $$a$$, and $$c$$ for the second one. Hence, $$a = c$$.
* perpendicular: Here, the expression is $$ac = -1$$. This means that $$c$$ and $$d$$ are multiplicative inverses of each other (i.e. reciprocals), and if $$a$$ is positive, then $$c$$ is negative, and vice versa.
